## API documentation basics

LibSass as a C-API comes with multiple headers and a shared library.
The complete API surface is covered by functions and by passing around
anonymous structures. The implementor does not know any implementation
detail about the pointers passed around.

### C-API headers

You may include specific headers directly, which have been split into
groups as we saw fit, or you can simply include the main `sass.h` header.

### List of C-API headers

- sass/base.h - Includes basic headers and sets a few definitions.
- sass/fwdecl.h - Forward declares all known anonymous structures.
- sass/enums.h - Enums for e.g. config options exposed on the C-API.
- sass/error.h - C-API functions to access `SassError` structs.
- sass/import.h - C-API functions to access `SassImport` structs.
- sass/importer.h - C-API functions to access `SassImporter` structs.
- sass/traces.h - C-API functions to access `SassTrace` structs.
- sass/values.h - C-API functions to access `SassValue` structs.
- sass/variable.h - C-API functions to access scoped variables.
- sass/version.h - Header including hardcoded LibSass version.

## Anonymous structure pointers

LibSass returns and consumes anonymous structure pointers on its C-API.
Internally those are often directly mapped to an instance of a C++ object.
Since we don't want implementors to know anything about the implementation
details, we forward declare named structs (e.g. `SassCompiler`), but never
provide any implementation for it. LibSass will simply cast a pointer from
the c++ side to the anonymous struct and relies on the C-API to pass it
back as expected to the corresponding functions. There the pointer will
be statically casted back to the actual implementation. Since we provide
a unique anonymous struct for every internal type, this should be safe as
compilers should catch the case when arguments mismatch on the C-API side.

### List of anonymous structure pointers

These structs have no real implementation are only passed around as pointers.
Internally in LibSass those pointers represent mostly different c++ objects.

- struct SassTrace - An single stack-trace object to get further information
- struct SassError - An error object to get further information
- struct SassCompiler - Main object to hold state for whole compilation phase.
- struct SassFunction - Custom function object holding callback and cookie.
- struct SassSource - Imported source with associated import and resolved path.
- struct SassSrcSpan - Parser state for column, line and source information.
- struct SassImport - Single import for entry point or returned by custom importer.
- struct SassImporter - Custom importer function to be hooked into our loading.
- struct SassImportList - Custom importers can return a list of imports.
- struct SassMapIterator - Object to support iteration API over map objects.

## Why using c++11 (or gcc4.4 compatibility)

Since LibSass 3.0 we started to use more and more c++11 features. Some just
creeped in, others were utilized deliberately. With LibSass 4.0 I took the
decision to fully utilize whatever c++11 could offer. The main reason to
fully embrace c++11 is the move semantics it brings. Earlier we also tried
to support compilers that only had partial c++11 support (e.g. gnu++0x).

With LibSass 4.0 we don't really support this target anymore!

Note: currently the LibSass 4.0 release is on going, the target
compiler should be gcc 4.8 as it should fully support c++11.

## Binary distributions in linkage issues

LibSass itself does not have any official binary distribution. The main reason for
this is because it is nearly impossible to do so reliably for each and every
thinkable operating system. Since LibSass is written in c++ we e.g. depend on the
compilers c++ runtime library. On windows this problem is a bit less problematic,
and there is a semi-official installer for it. But on Linux this e.g. is also
depending on the used libc library. Since linux offers a choice here, a binary
distribution made with glibc may not be compatible on a system that use musl.

By now LibSass is readily available on a lot of linux systems by their
internal packet managers, so please try to install it that way. Alternatively
try to install a recent compiler (e.g. gcc or clang) and compile it from source,
preferably via the autotools way to ensure correct linkage of your external tool.
